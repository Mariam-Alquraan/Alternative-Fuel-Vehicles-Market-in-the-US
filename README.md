## **Introduction**

### **Business Context**
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) is an NGO that provides research to environmental authorities worldwide. As part of a team preparing a report on the AFV market in the US, this analysis aims to characterize the market, focusing on energy efficiency, sales trends, and geographical distribution.

### **Business Problem**
The primary objective is to:
- Analyze the AFV market in the US and Washington state.
- Provide insights into energy efficiency trends over time.
- Examine the geographical distribution of AFVs.

### **Analytical Context**
The analysis is based on the `vehicles.xlsm` Excel file, which contains four tabs of raw data:
1. **Sales**: Aggregated sales figures for the US.
2. **Models**: Data on EV types.
3. **Range Data**: Information about the ranges of electric vehicles.
4. **EV Data**: A census of all electric vehicles in circulation in Washington state.

## **Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the raw data in Excel.
- **Analysis**: Perform calculations and create visualizations to answer key questions.
- **Results**: Summarize findings in the `ANSWER` tab of the Excel file.

## **Files in This Repository**
- `vehicles.xlsm`: The raw dataset containing sales, models, range data, and EV census data.
- `EV-Answers.xlsx`: The final Excel file with analysis and answers to key questions.
